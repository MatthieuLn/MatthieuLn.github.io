Matthieu Lainé is a doctoral candidate in ethnomusicology at the Sorbonne. His work focuses on zithers in East Asia (China, Korea, Japan). In his dissertation, he seeks to show how zithers reflect processes of borrowing, transmission, and innovation in East Asia. Supervised by Sylvie Le Bomin and Guillaume Lecointre, his research is shaped by the methods of musical systematics and by approaches borrowed from evolutionary studies applied to human culture. To anchor his research within society, he shows a strong interest in scientific and musical outreach.
